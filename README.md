# Disney+ Exploratory Analysis - TV Shows and Movies

## Project Description
This project performs an exploratory analysis of TV shows and movies available on Disney+. It covers various aspects of the content, such as distribution of genres, content types, release years, ratings, and more. The analysis includes visualizations to help understand trends and patterns in the Disney+ library.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Sources**: 
    - A dataset containing information about Disney+ TV shows and movies, including titles, genres, release years, content types (movie, TV show), ratings, and more.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
    - Handling missing values and duplicates.
    - Data type conversions and renaming columns for consistency.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Analyzing the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
    - Examining genre distribution and its evolution over time.
    - Investigating the impact of release year on content availability.
    - Visualizing ratings and analyzing trends in the data.

4. **Data Visualization**:
    - Creating interactive visualizations (e.g., pie charts, histograms) to show trends and distributions.
    - Using libraries like `Plotly` for interactive graphs and `Matplotlib` for static visualizations.

5. **Content Analysis**:
    - Exploring the number of content items added over the years.
    - Understanding the balance between TV shows and movies.

### Use Cases:
- **Content Trend Analysis**: Examine trends in Disney+ content over the years, including genre shifts and ratings.
- **Genre Distribution**: Understand the most popular genres and how they have evolved.
- **TV Shows vs Movies**: Investigate the distribution between TV shows and movies in the Disney+ library.
- **Rating Analysis**: Analyze how content is rated and its relationship with other attributes like release year or genre.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualizations of distribution across genres, content types, ratings, and more.
- Interactive pie charts and histograms.
- Yearly content addition analysis.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Plotly & Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Installation

To run the project, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Execute the code cells to:
   - Import necessary libraries
   - Clean and preprocess the data
   - Generate visualizations and analysis
4. The results will be displayed in the notebook as interactive visualizations.

### Sample Output (Visualizations):

- **Content Type Distribution**: A pie chart showing the proportion of movies vs TV shows.
- **Genre Distribution**: Bar chart showing the number of TV shows and movies per genre over the years.
- **Ratings Trends**: A line chart showing the average ratings over time for different content types.
